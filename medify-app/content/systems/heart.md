## How It Works & Why It's Critical

Your heart is a powerful muscle that acts like a pump, circulating blood throughout your entire body. It's about the size of your fist and beats about 100,000 times per day!

**The heart has four chambers:**
- **Right atrium**: Receives blood from the body
- **Right ventricle**: Pumps blood to the lungs
- **Left atrium**: Receives blood from the lungs
- **Left ventricle**: Pumps blood to the entire body

**The cardiovascular system includes:**
- **Heart**: The main pump
- **Blood vessels**: Arteries (carry blood away), veins (carry blood back), capillaries (tiny vessels)
- **Blood**: Carries oxygen, nutrients, and waste products

**Why it's critical:**
- Delivers oxygen and nutrients to every cell in your body
- Removes waste products like carbon dioxide
- Helps regulate body temperature
- Transports hormones and immune cells
- Maintains blood pressure and circulation

Without your heart, your body wouldn't get the oxygen and nutrients it needs to survive.

## Common Health Issues

### ❤️ **High Blood Pressure (Hypertension)**
**What it is**: Blood pressure consistently above normal levels, often called the "silent killer" because it can cause serious problems without symptoms.

**Why it happens**:
- **Poor diet**: Too much salt, processed foods, or alcohol
- **Lack of exercise**: Physical inactivity weakens the heart
- **Stress**: Chronic stress can raise blood pressure
- **Genetics**: High blood pressure runs in families
- **Smoking**: Damages blood vessels and raises blood pressure

**What you feel**:
- Often no symptoms (silent killer)
- Headaches, especially in the morning
- Dizziness or lightheadedness
- Shortness of breath
- Chest pain or pressure

**How to help yourself**:
- **Eat healthy**: Focus on fruits, vegetables, and whole grains
- **Exercise regularly**: 30 minutes most days of the week
- **Manage stress**: Practice relaxation techniques
- **Don't smoke**: Quit smoking to improve heart health
- **Limit alcohol**: No more than 1 drink per day for women, 2 for men

### ❤️ **Heart Disease (Coronary Artery Disease)**
**What it is**: Narrowing or blockage of heart arteries that supply blood to the heart muscle, like having clogged pipes in your heart's plumbing system.

**Why it happens**:
- **High cholesterol**: Fatty deposits in blood vessels
- **Smoking**: Damages blood vessels and reduces oxygen
- **Diabetes**: High blood sugar damages blood vessels
- **High blood pressure**: Puts strain on heart and blood vessels
- **Family history**: Heart disease runs in families

**What you feel**:
- Chest pain or pressure
- Shortness of breath
- Fatigue and weakness
- Irregular heartbeat
- Pain in arms, neck, jaw, or back

**How to help yourself**:
- **Quit smoking**: Most important thing you can do
- **Eat healthy**: Focus on heart-healthy foods
- **Exercise regularly**: Strengthens your heart
- **Manage stress**: Practice relaxation techniques
- **Take medications**: As prescribed by your doctor

### ❤️ **Heart Attack (Myocardial Infarction)**
**What it is**: Complete blockage of blood flow to part of the heart, causing heart muscle damage. It's like having a traffic jam that stops all blood flow to part of your heart.

**Why it happens**:
- **Blood clot**: In coronary artery
- **Plaque buildup**: Fatty deposits in arteries
- **Artery spasm**: Sudden tightening of artery
- **Risk factors**: Smoking, diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol

**What you feel**:
- Chest pain or pressure
- Shortness of breath
- Nausea and vomiting
- Sweating and cold sweats
- Pain in arm, jaw, or back
- Dizziness or fainting

**How to help yourself**:
- **Call emergency services**: Immediately if you think you're having a heart attack
- **Take aspirin**: If recommended by emergency services
- **Stay calm**: Try to remain as calm as possible
- **Don't drive**: Have someone else drive you to the hospital
- **Follow treatment plan**: After recovery, follow doctor's recommendations

### ❤️ **Heart Failure**
**What it is**: Heart can't pump blood effectively throughout the body, like having a weak pump that can't move water through pipes properly.

**Why it happens**:
- **Heart disease**: Previous heart attacks or coronary artery disease
- **High blood pressure**: Puts strain on the heart
- **Diabetes**: Damages blood vessels and heart muscle
- **Previous heart attack**: Damages heart muscle
- **Heart valve problems**: Valves don't work properly
- **Symptoms**: Shortness of breath, fatigue, swelling in legs/feet, rapid heartbeat
- **Management**: Medication, lifestyle changes, monitoring, possible surgery

### Arrhythmia (Irregular Heartbeat)
- **What**: Heart beats too fast, too slow, or irregularly
- **Causes**: Heart disease, stress, caffeine, medications, genetics
- **Symptoms**: Palpitations, dizziness, chest pain, shortness of breath
- **Management**: Medication, lifestyle changes, procedures, pacemaker

### Stroke
- **What**: Blood flow to brain is interrupted
- **Causes**: Blood clot, bleeding in brain, high blood pressure
- **Symptoms**: Sudden weakness, speech problems, vision issues, severe headache
- **Management**: Emergency treatment, rehabilitation, prevention

### Peripheral Artery Disease
- **What**: Narrowing of arteries in legs/arms
- **Causes**: Smoking, diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol
- **Symptoms**: Leg pain when walking, cold feet, slow-healing wounds
- **Management**: Exercise, medication, lifestyle changes, procedures

### Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT)
- **What**: Blood clot in deep veins, usually in legs
- **Causes**: Prolonged sitting, surgery, injury, certain medications
- **Symptoms**: Leg pain, swelling, warmth, redness
- **Management**: Blood thinners, compression stockings, movement

## Prevention Tips

- **Exercise regularly** (at least 150 minutes per week)
- **Eat heart-healthy foods** (fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins)
- **Limit salt intake** to reduce blood pressure
- **Don't smoke** and avoid secondhand smoke
- **Limit alcohol** consumption
- **Manage stress** through relaxation techniques
- **Get regular checkups** and monitor blood pressure/cholesterol
- **Maintain healthy weight**
- **Get enough sleep** (7-9 hours per night)
- **Stay hydrated** and drink plenty of water
