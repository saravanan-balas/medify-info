## What is it?

Constipation means having trouble pooping or not pooping as often as usual. Everyone's "normal" is different - some people poop three times a day, others three times a week. You're constipated when your poop becomes hard, dry, and difficult to pass, or when you go less often than what's normal for you.

## How do you get it?

Constipation can happen for many reasons:
- **Not drinking enough water** - your body needs water to keep poop soft
- **Not eating enough fiber** - fruits, vegetables, and whole grains help things move
- **Not being active** - exercise helps your intestines work properly
- **Holding it in** - ignoring the urge to poop
- **Changes in routine** - traveling or stress
- **Some medications** can cause constipation
- **Eating too much cheese or dairy**
- **Not going when you need to**

## Symptoms

Signs you might be constipated:
- Pooping less than 3 times a week
- Hard, dry, or lumpy poop
- Straining or pain when pooping
- Feeling like you can't empty completely
- Bloated or uncomfortable belly
- Feeling like something is blocking your poop
- Needing to use your fingers to help
- Stomach cramps or pain
- Loss of appetite

## How to manage it?

To help relieve constipation:
- **Drink more water** - aim for 6-8 glasses a day
- **Eat more fiber** - fruits, vegetables, whole grain bread
- **Try prune juice** or eat prunes
- **Exercise** - even a short walk helps
- **Don't rush** - give yourself time on the toilet
- **Use a footstool** when sitting on the toilet
- **Massage your belly** in circular motions
- **Try warm drinks** in the morning
- **Consider mild laxatives** - but ask a pharmacist first
- **Go when you feel the urge** - don't wait

## How to prevent it?

Keep your bowels healthy by:
- **Stay hydrated** - water is your best friend
- **Eat fiber daily** - aim for 25-30 grams
  - Fruits: apples, pears, berries
  - Vegetables: broccoli, carrots, peas
  - Whole grains: brown rice, oatmeal, whole wheat bread
- **Exercise regularly** - at least 30 minutes most days
- **Establish a routine** - try to poop at the same time daily

- **Limit processed foods** and excessive dairy
- **Manage stress** - it can affect your digestion
- **Avoid excessive caffeine** which can dehydrate you
