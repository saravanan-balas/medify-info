title: Acid Reflux
description: Burning sensation in chest or throat when stomach acid backs up into the esophagus
---

## What is it?

Acid reflux happens when stomach acid flows back up into your esophagus (the tube connecting your mouth to your stomach). This causes a burning feeling in your chest, often called heartburn. When this happens frequently (more than twice a week), it's called GERD (Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease).

## How do you get it?

Acid reflux occurs when:
- **The muscle at the bottom of your esophagus** (lower esophageal sphincter) doesn't close properly
- **Eating large meals** puts pressure on this muscle
- **Lying down after eating** allows acid to flow back
- **Being overweight** increases stomach pressure
- **Pregnancy** can push on the stomach
- **Certain foods** trigger it more than others
- **Smoking** weakens the esophageal muscle
- **Some medications** can cause reflux
- **Hiatal hernia** (when part of stomach pushes through diaphragm)

## Symptoms

Common signs of acid reflux:
- **Heartburn** - burning in chest, usually after eating
- **Chest pain** especially when lying down
- **Difficulty swallowing**
- **Regurgitation** - sour or bitter taste in mouth
- **Feeling of lump in throat**
- **Chronic cough** especially at night
- **Hoarseness** or sore throat
- **Bad breath**
- **Nausea** after eating
- **Bloating and burping**

## How to manage it?

To relieve acid reflux:
- **Sit upright** after eating for at least 3 hours
- **Elevate your head** when sleeping (use extra pillows)
- **Eat smaller meals** more frequently
- **Avoid trigger foods** (see prevention section)
- **Loosen tight clothing** around your waist
- **Sip water** to wash acid back down
- **Try antacids** for quick relief
- **Chew gum** after meals to increase saliva
- **Don't smoke** or use tobacco
- **Wait before exercising** after eating

**See a doctor if:**
- Symptoms occur more than twice a week
- Symptoms don't improve with lifestyle changes
- You have difficulty swallowing
- You're losing weight without trying
- You have persistent nausea or vomiting

## How to prevent it?

Reduce acid reflux by:
- **Avoid trigger foods:**
  - Citrus fruits and juices
  - Tomatoes and tomato sauce
  - Spicy foods
  - Fatty or fried foods
  - Chocolate
  - Coffee and caffeinated drinks
  - Alcohol
  - Peppermint
  - Onions and garlic
- **Maintain healthy weight** - extra weight increases pressure
- **Don't lie down** for 3 hours after eating
- **Eat slowly** and chew thoroughly
- **Wear loose clothes** especially around waist
- **Raise the head of your bed** 6-8 inches
- **Quit smoking** if you smoke
- **Manage stress** through relaxation techniques
- **Keep a food diary** to identify your triggers
- **Stay hydrated** between meals, not during
