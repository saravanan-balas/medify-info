## What is it?

Diarrhea means having loose, watery poop that happens more often than usual. It's your body's way of quickly getting rid of something that shouldn't be there. While uncomfortable, it usually goes away on its own within a few days. However, it can lead to dehydration if you lose too much fluid.

## How do you get it?

Common causes of diarrhea include:
- **Stomach bug** (viral or bacterial infection)
- **Food poisoning** from contaminated food
- **Eating something that disagrees with you**
- **Food intolerances** (like lactose intolerance)
- **Antibiotics** or other medications
- **Stress or anxiety**
- **Too much caffeine or alcohol**
- **Artificial sweeteners** in sugar-free products
- **Traveler's diarrhea** from unfamiliar bacteria
- **Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)**
- **Eating too much fruit** or fatty foods

## Symptoms

Along with loose, watery stools, you might have:
- Urgent need to use the bathroom
- Cramping or pain in your belly
- Bloating
- Nausea
- Fever (if infected)
- Blood or mucus in stool (see doctor)
- Dehydration signs:
  - Dry mouth
  - Feeling very thirsty
  - Little or no pee
  - Dizziness

## How to manage it?

To manage diarrhea:
- **Stay hydrated** - this is most important!
  - Drink water, clear broths, or electrolyte drinks
  - Avoid milk, coffee, alcohol, and fizzy drinks

  - **R**ice (white)
  - **A**pplesauce
  - **T**oast (white bread)
- **Rest** to help your body recover
- **Avoid** dairy, fatty, spicy, or high-fiber foods
- **Try probiotics** (yogurt with live cultures when better)

- **Wash hands frequently** to avoid spreading infection

**See a doctor if you have:**
