## What is it?

Vomiting (throwing up) is when your stomach forcefully empties its contents through your mouth. It's usually preceded by nausea (feeling sick). While unpleasant, vomiting is your body's way of getting rid of something harmful or irritating. It's a symptom, not an illness itself, and usually improves within a day or two.

## How do you get it?

Common causes of vomiting include:
- **Stomach bug** (gastroenteritis)
- **Food poisoning** from bad or contaminated food

- **Migraine headaches**
- **Alcohol** consumption
- **Stress or anxiety**
