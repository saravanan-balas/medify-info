## What is it?

Blood in poop (also called rectal bleeding) means you see blood when you wipe, in the toilet bowl, or mixed with your stool. The blood can look bright red, dark red, or black and tarry. While it can be scary to see, it's often caused by minor issues like hemorrhoids. However, it should always be checked by a doctor to rule out serious conditions.

## How do you get it?

Common causes include:
- **Hemorrhoids (piles)** - swollen blood vessels in the rectum
- **Anal fissures** - small tears from passing hard stools
- **Constipation** causing straining and tears
- **Diarrhea** irritating the rectum
- **Food coloring** (red foods like beets - not actual blood)
- **Inflammatory bowel disease** (Crohn's, ulcerative colitis)
- **Stomach ulcers** (causes dark/black stools)
- **Polyps or tumors** (less common but serious)
- **Certain medications** like iron supplements (dark stools)

## Symptoms

What to look for:
- **Bright red blood:**
  - On toilet paper when wiping
  - Dripping into toilet bowl
  - Coating the outside of stool
  - Usually from lower digestive tract

- **Dark red or maroon blood:**
  - Mixed throughout the stool
  - From higher up in the colon

- **Black, tarry stools:**
  - Like coffee grounds
