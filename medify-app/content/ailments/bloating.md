description: Feeling of fullness, tightness, or swelling in the abdomen
---

## What is it?

Bloating is when your belly feels full, tight, and sometimes swollen. It's like your stomach has been inflated like a balloon. This happens when gas builds up in your digestive system or when your body retains extra fluid. While uncomfortable, bloating is usually not serious and can be managed with simple changes.

## How do you get it?

Bloating can be caused by:
- **Swallowing air** while eating or drinking quickly
- **Gas-producing foods** in your diet
- **Eating too much** at once
- **Constipation** blocking gas from passing
- **Food intolerances** (lactose, gluten)
- **Fizzy drinks** adding gas to your system
- **Menstrual cycle** causing water retention
- **Eating too fast** without chewing properly
- **Stress** affecting digestion
- **Certain medications**
- **Imbalance of gut bacteria**

## Symptoms

When you're bloated, you might experience:
- Stomach feels full and tight
- Visible swelling of the belly
- Stomach feels hard when touched
- Passing gas more than usual
- Burping frequently
- Rumbling or gurgling sounds
- Mild stomach pain or cramps
- Feeling uncomfortable in clothes
- Difficulty breathing deeply
- General discomfort

## How to manage it?

To relieve bloating:
- **Walk around** - gentle movement helps gas move through
- **Try yoga poses** like child's pose or knee-to-chest
- **Massage your belly** in circular motions
- **Apply heat** with a heating pad
- **Sip peppermint tea** or ginger tea
- **Take deep breaths** to help relax

## How to prevent it?

Reduce bloating by:
- **Eat slowly** and chew food thoroughly
- **Avoid foods that cause gas:**
  - Beans and lentils
  - Broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage
  - Onions and garlic
  - Carbonated drinks
  - Artificial sweeteners
  - Very fatty foods
- **Limit salt intake** to reduce water retention
- **Stay hydrated** with plain water
- **Exercise regularly** to keep digestion moving
- **Don't chew gum** (causes air swallowing)
- **Eat smaller meals** more frequently
- **Keep a food diary** to identify triggers
- **Try probiotics** for gut health
- **Manage stress** with relaxation techniques
- **Don't use straws** (increases air swallowing)
