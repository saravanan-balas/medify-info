## What is it?

Travel sickness, also called motion sickness, happens when your brain gets confused by different signals from your body. When you're in a moving vehicle, your eyes might see things staying still (like the inside of a car), but your inner ear feels the movement. This mixed message makes you feel sick.

## How do you get it?

Travel sickness isn't something you "catch" like a cold. It happens because:
- Your inner ear senses motion but your eyes don't see it
- Reading or looking at screens while traveling
- Sitting in the back seat where you can't see the road ahead
- Winding roads or rough seas
- Strong smells in the vehicle
- Not enough fresh air

## Symptoms

Common signs of travel sickness include:
- Feeling queasy or nauseous
- Dizziness or feeling lightheaded
- Cold sweats
- Headache
- Increased saliva (watery mouth)
- Pale skin
- Vomiting in severe cases
- General feeling of being unwell

## How to manage it?

If you're feeling travel sick, try these tips:
- **Look at the horizon** or a fixed point in the distance
- **Get fresh air** - open a window or step outside if possible
- **Take breaks** during long journeys
- **Sit in the front seat** of a car or middle of a boat
- **Close your eyes** and rest your head back
- **Avoid reading** or using phones/tablets
- **Sip water** or suck on ginger candies
- **Use acupressure bands** on your wrists
- **Take motion sickness medication** before traveling (ask a pharmacist)

## How to prevent it?

You can reduce your chances of getting travel sick by:
- **Eat light** - avoid heavy meals before traveling
- **Avoid alcohol** and excessive caffeine
- **Choose your seat wisely** - front of car, wing of plane, middle of ship
- **Face forward** in the direction of travel
- **Keep your head still** - use a headrest
- **Stay hydrated** but avoid fizzy drinks
- **Get enough sleep** before traveling
- **Avoid strong smells** like perfume or food odors
- **Focus on the horizon** rather than nearby objects
- **Consider medication** if you're prone to travel sickness
