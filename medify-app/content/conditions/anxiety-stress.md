## What Are Anxiety & Stress?

Anxiety is like having an overactive alarm system in your brain - it's constantly warning you about potential dangers, even when you're safe. It's your brain's way of trying to protect you, but sometimes it goes into overdrive.

Stress is your body's response to pressure or demands. It's like your body's way of saying "Hey, something important is happening!" But when stress becomes too much or lasts too long, it can make you feel overwhelmed.

### Types of Anxiety

**Generalized Anxiety** - Worrying about many things most of the time
**Social Anxiety** - Fear of being judged or embarrassed in social situations
**Panic Attacks** - Sudden, intense fear that comes out of nowhere
**Phobias** - Extreme fear of specific things like heights, spiders, or flying

## Why Do Anxiety & Stress Happen?

### What Happens in Your Brain

When you feel anxious, your brain thinks there's danger nearby. It releases chemicals that make your heart beat faster, your muscles tense up, and your breathing quicken. This is called the "fight or flight" response.
