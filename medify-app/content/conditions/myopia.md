# Myopia (Nearsightedness)

**What it is**: Can see close objects clearly but distant objects appear blurry. It's like having a camera that focuses well on nearby objects but struggles with faraway objects.

## Why it happens

- **Eye shape**: Eyeball is too long or cornea is too curved
- **Genetics**: Often runs in families
- **Eye strain**: Too much close work like reading or computer use
- **Lack of outdoor time**: Not enough natural light exposure
- **Rapid growth**: During childhood and teenage years
- **Environmental factors**: Urban living and education levels

## What you feel

- **Blurry distant vision**: Difficulty seeing far objects clearly
- **Squinting**: Trying to see distant objects better
- **Headaches**: From eye strain
- **Eye fatigue**: Tired eyes after prolonged near work
- **Difficulty seeing**: Road signs, blackboards, or TV screens
- **Need to sit closer**: To see things clearly

## How to help yourself

- **Wear corrective lenses**: Glasses or contact lenses as prescribed
- **Take breaks**: Follow the 20-20-20 rule (every 20 minutes, look at something 20 feet away for 20 seconds)
- **Spend time outdoors**: Natural light helps eye development
- **Use proper lighting**: Ensure good lighting for reading and work
- **Regular eye exams**: Get your eyes checked regularly
- **Limit screen time**: Especially for children
- **Practice good posture**: When reading or using devices

## The 20-20-20 rule

- **Every 20 minutes**: Take a break from close work
- **Look at something 20 feet away**: Focus on distant objects
- **For 20 seconds**: Give your eyes time to relax
- **Blink frequently**: Keep your eyes moist
- **Adjust lighting**: Avoid glare and harsh lighting

## Prevention tips

- **Spend time outdoors**: At least 2 hours per day for children
- **Limit close work**: Take regular breaks from reading and screens
- **Use proper lighting**: Avoid reading in dim light
- **Maintain distance**: Keep reading material at arm's length
- **Regular checkups**: Get eye exams as recommended
- **Healthy diet**: Eat foods rich in vitamins A, C, and E

## Treatment options

- **Glasses**: Most common and effective treatment
- **Contact lenses**: For those who prefer not to wear glasses
- **Laser surgery**: LASIK or other procedures for adults
- **Orthokeratology**: Special contact lenses worn at night
- **Atropine drops**: Low-dose eye drops to slow progression

## When to see an eye doctor

- **Blurry vision**: That doesn't improve with rest
- **Frequent headaches**: From eye strain
- **Difficulty seeing**: Road signs or distant objects
- **Squinting**: To see things clearly
- **Eye fatigue**: After short periods of reading
- **Changes in vision**: Any sudden changes

## Signs in children

- **Sitting too close**: To TV or computer screens
- **Squinting**: When looking at distant objects
- **Rubbing eyes**: Frequently
- **Complaining**: About not being able to see
- **Poor performance**: In school or sports
- **Headaches**: After reading or close work

## Lifestyle changes

- **Reduce screen time**: Especially for children
- **Increase outdoor time**: Natural light exposure
- **Improve lighting**: At home and work
- **Take regular breaks**: From close work
- **Practice good posture**: When reading or using devices
- **Maintain healthy diet**: Rich in eye-healthy nutrients

## Common misconceptions

- **Wearing glasses makes eyes weaker**: Not true, glasses help your eyes work properly
- **Only children get nearsightedness**: Can develop at any age
- **Reading in dim light causes it**: Not a direct cause but can contribute to eye strain
- **Sitting too close to TV causes it**: Not a direct cause but can indicate existing vision problems

## Complications

- **Eye strain**: From uncorrected vision
- **Headaches**: From squinting and eye strain
- **Safety issues**: Difficulty seeing while driving
- **Learning problems**: In children with uncorrected vision
- **Social issues**: Difficulty participating in activities

Remember: Myopia is very common and easily treatable with glasses, contact lenses, or surgery. Regular eye exams are important to detect and treat vision problems early.
