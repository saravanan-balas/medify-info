## What Is Depression?

Depression is like having a dark cloud that follows you everywhere, making everything seem harder and less enjoyable. It's not just feeling sad - it's a real medical condition that affects your brain chemistry.

Everyone feels sad sometimes, but depression is different. It's like having sadness that won't go away and affects every part of your life.
