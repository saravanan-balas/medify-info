## What Is Pneumonia?

Pneumonia is like having your lungs filled with water - it makes it hard to breathe because the air sacs in your lungs get filled with fluid or pus instead of air. It's an infection that can make you very sick.

Normally, your lungs are like sponges that fill with air when you breathe. In pneumonia, the air sacs get filled with fluid, making it hard for oxygen to get into your blood.

**Viral Pneumonia** - Caused by viruses, usually less severe

**Aspiration Pneumonia** - Caused by inhaling food or liquid
