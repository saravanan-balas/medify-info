# Acid Reflux (GERD)

**What it is**: When stomach acid flows back up into your esophagus (the tube that carries food from your mouth to your stomach). It's like having a leaky valve that lets stomach contents flow the wrong way.

## Why it happens

- **Weak muscle**: The muscle that keeps stomach acid down gets weak
- **Eating too much**: Large meals put pressure on the stomach
- **Certain foods**: Spicy, fatty, or acidic foods can trigger it
- **Smoking**: Weakens the muscle that prevents acid from flowing up
- **Being overweight**: Extra weight puts pressure on your stomach
- **Pregnancy**: Hormones and pressure from the baby can cause reflux

## What you feel

- **Heartburn**: Burning feeling in your chest
- **Chest pain**: Can feel like a heart attack
- **Sour taste**: Bitter or sour taste in your mouth
- **Difficulty swallowing**: Food feels stuck in your throat
- **Regurgitation**: Food or liquid comes back up
- **Cough**: Chronic cough, especially at night
- **Hoarse voice**: From acid irritating your throat

## How to help yourself

- **Eat smaller meals**: Don't overeat
- **Avoid trigger foods**: Spicy, fatty, or acidic foods
- **Don't lie down after eating**: Wait 2-3 hours before lying down
- **Elevate your head**: Use extra pillows when sleeping
- **Lose weight**: If you're overweight
- **Don't smoke**: Smoking makes it worse
- **Wear loose clothes**: Tight clothes can put pressure on your stomach

## When to see a doctor

- Symptoms happen more than twice a week
- Over-the-counter medicines don't help
- Difficulty swallowing
- Weight loss without trying
- Chest pain that feels like a heart attack

## Treatment options

- **Lifestyle changes**: Diet and habit modifications
- **Over-the-counter medicines**: Antacids and acid reducers
- **Prescription medicines**: Stronger acid blockers
- **Surgery**: In severe cases that don't respond to other treatments

Remember: Acid reflux is common and treatable. With the right lifestyle changes and treatment, most people can manage their symptoms effectively.
