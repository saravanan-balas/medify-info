## What Is COPD?

COPD is like having damaged air bags in your lungs that can't inflate and deflate properly. It makes it hard to breathe because the airways get narrowed and the lung tissue gets damaged.

COPD is actually two conditions combined:
- **Chronic Bronchitis**: Airways get inflamed and produce too much mucus
- **Emphysema**: Air sacs in the lungs get damaged and can't work properly

### What Happens in Your Lungs

Normally, your lungs are like sponges that expand and contract to bring in oxygen and remove carbon dioxide. In COPD, the airways get narrowed and the air sacs get damaged, making it harder to breathe.

## Why Does COPD Happen?

### Common Causes

- **Smoking**: The most common cause - damages lung tissue over time
- **Secondhand smoke**: Breathing in smoke from others
- **Air pollution**: Breathing in dirty air for long periods
- **Workplace chemicals**: Dust, fumes, or chemicals at work
- **Genetics**: Some people are more susceptible to lung damage
- **Age**: Risk increases with age
- **Childhood respiratory infections**: Can damage developing lungs
- **Indoor air pollution**: Cooking fumes, heating fuels, or mold

### Risk Factors

- **Smoking history**: Current or former smokers
- **Age**: Most people diagnosed after age 40
- **Gender**: Women may be more susceptible to lung damage
- **Family history**: COPD can run in families
- **Asthma**: People with asthma are at higher risk
- **Occupational exposure**: Jobs with dust, fumes, or chemicals
- **Socioeconomic factors**: Poor air quality in some areas

## What You Feel

### Early Symptoms
- **Shortness of breath**: Especially with activity
- **Chronic cough**: Cough that won't go away
- **Mucus production**: Coughing up phlegm or sputum
- **Wheezing**: Whistling sound when breathing
- **Chest tightness**: Feeling of pressure in chest
- **Fatigue**: Feeling very tired
- **Frequent respiratory infections**: Colds, flu, or pneumonia
- **Morning headaches**: From low oxygen levels

### Advanced Symptoms
- **Severe shortness of breath**: Even at rest
- **Chronic cough**: Persistent cough with mucus
- **Chest infections**: Frequent pneumonia or bronchitis
- **Weight loss**: Unintended weight loss
- **Swelling**: In legs, ankles, or feet
- **Bluish lips or fingernails**: From low oxygen levels
- **Confusion**: Mental changes from low oxygen
- **Sleep problems**: Difficulty sleeping due to breathing problems

### Exacerbations (Flare-ups)
- **Worsening symptoms**: Sudden increase in breathing problems
- **Increased mucus**: More phlegm or change in color
- **Fever**: Sign of infection
- **Chest pain**: Discomfort or pressure
- **Severe fatigue**: Extreme tiredness
- **Confusion**: Mental changes
- **Difficulty sleeping**: Can't lie flat due to breathing problems

## How to Help Yourself

### Lifestyle Changes
- **Quit smoking**: Most important thing you can do
- **Avoid secondhand smoke**: Stay away from people who smoke
- **Stay active**: Regular exercise can help improve breathing
- **Eat healthy**: Good nutrition supports lung health
- **Get enough sleep**: Rest is important for your body
- **Manage stress**: Stress can make breathing problems worse
- **Avoid air pollution**: Stay indoors when air quality is poor
- **Get vaccinated**: Flu and pneumonia shots are important

### Breathing Techniques
- **Pursed-lip breathing**: Breathe in through nose, out through pursed lips
- **Diaphragmatic breathing**: Use your diaphragm to breathe deeply
- **Coughing techniques**: Learn to cough effectively to clear mucus
- **Relaxation breathing**: Slow, deep breaths to reduce anxiety
- **Energy conservation**: Pace yourself to avoid getting too tired
- **Positioning**: Find comfortable positions for breathing

### Exercise and Physical Activity
- **Walking**: Start with short walks and build up
- **Swimming**: Great exercise that's easy on joints
- **Cycling**: Stationary bike or outdoor cycling
- **Light weights**: Strength training can help
- **Stretching**: Yoga or gentle stretching
- **Pulmonary rehabilitation**: Supervised exercise program
- **Start slowly**: Begin with 5-10 minutes and build up
- **Listen to your body**: Stop if you feel chest pain or dizziness

### Diet and Nutrition
- **Eat smaller meals**: Large meals can make breathing harder
- **Stay hydrated**: Drink plenty of water
- **Limit salt**: Too much salt can cause fluid retention
- **Eat protein**: Helps maintain muscle strength
- **Fruits and vegetables**: Provide important vitamins and minerals
