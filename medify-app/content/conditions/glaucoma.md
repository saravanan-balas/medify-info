## What Is Glaucoma?

Glaucoma is like having too much pressure in your eye - it can damage your optic nerve and cause vision loss. It's often called the "silent thief of sight" because it can cause permanent vision loss without warning.

Your eye produces a clear fluid called aqueous humor that nourishes the eye. Normally, this fluid drains out of the eye. In glaucoma, the fluid doesn't drain properly, causing pressure to build up and damage the optic nerve.

### Types of Glaucoma

**Open-angle glaucoma** - Most common type, develops slowly
**Angle-closure glaucoma** - Less common, can develop quickly
**Normal-tension glaucoma** - Occurs with normal eye pressure
**Congenital glaucoma** - Present at birth
**Secondary glaucoma** - Caused by other diseases or medications

## Why Does Glaucoma Happen?

### Common Causes

- **High eye pressure**: Most common cause
- **Age**: Risk increases with age, especially after 60
- **Family history**: Glaucoma runs in families
- **Race**: African Americans are at higher risk
- **Diabetes**: High blood sugar can damage blood vessels
- **High blood pressure**: Can affect blood flow to the eye
- **Eye injury**: Trauma can damage drainage system
- **Certain medications**: Some drugs can increase eye pressure
- **Thin corneas**: People with thin corneas are at higher risk
- **Nearsightedness**: People who are nearsighted are at higher risk

### Risk Factors

- **Age**: Risk increases significantly after age 60
- **Family history**: Having relatives with glaucoma
- **Race**: African Americans, Hispanics, and Asians at higher risk
- **Diabetes**: Poor blood sugar control
- **High blood pressure**: Uncontrolled hypertension
- **Eye injury**: Previous eye trauma
- **Certain medications**: Long-term use of steroids
- **Thin corneas**: Measured during eye exams
- **Nearsightedness**: People who are nearsighted
- **Sleep apnea**: May increase risk
