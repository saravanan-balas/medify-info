## What is Asthma?

Asthma is a chronic lung condition where your airways become inflamed, narrow, and produce extra mucus, making it difficult to breathe. It's one of the most common chronic diseases, affecting millions of people worldwide.

## Symptoms

**Common symptoms include:**
- **Wheezing** - whistling sound when breathing
- **Shortness of breath** - feeling like you can't get enough air
- **Chest tightness** - feeling like something is squeezing your chest
- **Coughing** - especially at night or early morning
- **Difficulty sleeping** due to breathing problems
- **Fatigue** from breathing difficulties

**Severe symptoms (medical emergency):**
- Rapid breathing
- Inability to speak in full sentences
- Blue lips or fingernails
- No improvement after using inhaler

## Causes & Triggers

**Common triggers:**
- **Allergens** - pollen, dust mites, pet dander, mold
- **Exercise** - especially in cold, dry air
- **Cold air** and weather changes
- **Stress and strong emotions**
- **Respiratory infections** - colds, flu, sinus infections
- **Air pollution** and smoke
- **Certain medications** - aspirin, beta-blockers
- **Food additives** - sulfites in wine and processed foods

**Risk factors:**
- Family history of asthma or allergies
- Having allergies or eczema
- Exposure to secondhand smoke
- Obesity
- Occupational exposure to chemicals

## Diagnosis

**Tests your doctor may perform:**
- **Spirometry** - measures how much air you can exhale
- **Peak flow test** - measures how fast you can blow air out
- **Allergy testing** - identifies specific triggers
- **Chest X-ray** - rules out other conditions
- **Blood tests** - checks for inflammation markers

## Treatment & Management

**Quick-relief medications:**
- **Short-acting beta-agonists** (albuterol) - inhalers for immediate relief
- **Anticholinergics** - help open airways quickly

**Long-term control medications:**
- **Inhaled corticosteroids** - reduce airway inflammation
- **Long-acting beta-agonists** - keep airways open
- **Leukotriene modifiers** - block inflammation-causing chemicals
- **Theophylline** - helps relax airway muscles

**Other treatments:**
- **Allergy shots** (immunotherapy) for allergic asthma
- **Biologic medications** for severe asthma
- **Bronchial thermoplasty** for severe cases

## Living with Asthma

**Daily management:**
- **Use medications as prescribed** - don't skip doses
- **Monitor your breathing** with peak flow meter
- **Keep an asthma diary** to track symptoms and triggers
- **Have an action plan** for asthma attacks
- **Carry rescue inhaler** at all times

**Lifestyle modifications:**
- **Avoid known triggers** - dust, smoke, allergens
- **Exercise regularly** but warm up gradually
- **Maintain healthy weight**
- **Manage stress** through relaxation techniques
- **Get flu and pneumonia vaccines**

**Home environment:**
- **Use air purifiers** and HEPA filters
- **Wash bedding weekly** in hot water
- **Keep humidity levels** between 30-50%
- **Remove carpets** and use hardwood floors
- **Keep pets out of bedroom** if allergic

## Prevention

**Primary prevention:**
- **Avoid smoking** during pregnancy and around children
- **Breastfeed** infants for at least 6 months
- **Reduce exposure** to allergens and irritants
- **Maintain healthy weight** throughout life

**Secondary prevention:**
- **Take medications regularly** as prescribed
- **Monitor symptoms** and peak flow daily
- **Avoid triggers** identified through testing
- **Get regular checkups** with your doctor

## When to See a Doctor

**Seek immediate medical attention if:**
- Symptoms don't improve with rescue inhaler
- Peak flow readings are in red zone
- Difficulty speaking due to shortness of breath
- Lips or fingernails turn blue
- Rapid breathing or inability to catch breath

**Schedule an appointment if:**
- Symptoms occur more than twice a week
- Waking up at night due to asthma symptoms
- Using rescue inhaler more than twice a week
- Symptoms interfere with daily activities
- Need to refill rescue inhaler more than monthly

## Emergency Action Plan

**Green Zone (Good Control):**
- No symptoms
- Peak flow 80-100% of personal best
- Use daily controller medication

**Yellow Zone (Caution):**
- Mild symptoms
- Peak flow 50-80% of personal best
- Use rescue inhaler
- May need to increase controller medication

**Red Zone (Medical Alert):**
- Severe symptoms
- Peak flow less than 50% of personal best
- Use rescue inhaler immediately
- Seek emergency medical care

- American Lung Association
- Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America
- National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute

**Support groups:**
- Local asthma support groups
