## What Are Headaches & Migraines?

Headaches are like having a construction crew working inside your skull - they cause pain that can range from a mild annoyance to absolutely unbearable. Migraines are the "super headaches" that come with extra symptoms like nausea, sensitivity to light and sound, and sometimes visual disturbances.

### Types of Headaches

**Tension Headaches** - The most common type, feels like a tight band around your head
**Migraine Headaches** - Severe headaches with additional symptoms
**Cluster Headaches** - Intense pain that comes in groups or "clusters"
**Sinus Headaches** - Pain in your forehead, cheeks, and nose area

## Why Do Headaches Happen?

### Common Causes

- **Stress**: When you're worried or overwhelmed, your brain muscles tense up
- **Dehydration**: Not drinking enough water makes your brain shrink slightly, causing pain
- **Lack of sleep**: Your brain needs rest to repair itself - without it, it gets cranky
- **Certain foods**: Chocolate, cheese, and processed foods can trigger headaches in some people
- **Bright lights or loud noises**: Your brain can get overstimulated
- **Hormone changes**: Especially common in women during their monthly cycle
- **Weather changes**: Changes in barometric pressure can trigger headaches
- **Skipping meals**: Low blood sugar can cause headaches
- **Caffeine withdrawal**: If you usually drink coffee and skip it, you might get a headache

### Migraine Triggers

- **Food triggers**: Aged cheese, chocolate, red wine, processed meats
- **Environmental factors**: Bright lights, loud noises, strong smells
- **Sleep changes**: Too much or too little sleep
- **Stress**: Both physical and emotional stress
- **Weather changes**: Storms, high humidity, temperature changes

### Migraine Symptoms

- **Seeing spots or zigzag lines** (called an "aura") before the headache starts

- **Pain that comes in cycles** - headaches for weeks, then none for months
