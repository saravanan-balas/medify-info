# Constipation

**What it is**: Difficulty passing stools (poop) or having fewer bowel movements than usual. It's like having a traffic jam in your digestive system where things move too slowly.

## Why it happens

- **Low fiber diet**: Not enough fruits, vegetables, and whole grains
- **Dehydration**: Not drinking enough water
- **Lack of exercise**: Physical activity helps move things along
- **Medications**: Some medicines can cause constipation
- **Stress**: Emotional stress can affect bowel function
- **Ignoring the urge**: Not going when you feel the need
- **Travel**: Changes in routine can affect bowel habits
- **Pregnancy**: Hormones and pressure can slow things down

## What you feel

- **Hard, dry stools**: Difficult to pass
- **Straining**: Having to push hard to have a bowel movement
- **Feeling incomplete**: Like you didn't finish going
- **Bloating**: Feeling full and swollen
- **Abdominal pain**: Cramping or discomfort
- **Fewer bowel movements**: Less than 3 times per week
- **Small, pellet-like stools**: Hard and difficult to pass

## How to help yourself

- **Eat more fiber**: Fruits, vegetables, whole grains, beans
- **Drink more water**: At least 8 glasses per day
- **Exercise regularly**: Walking, swimming, or other activities
- **Don't ignore the urge**: Go when you feel the need
- **Establish a routine**: Try to go at the same time each day

## Foods to avoid

## When to see a doctor

- **Constipation with other symptoms**: Like nausea or vomiting

## Prevention tips

- **Start your day with fiber**: Eat breakfast with whole grains
- **Stay hydrated**: Drink water throughout the day
- **Move your body**: Even light exercise helps
- **Listen to your body**: Go when you feel the urge
- **Manage stress**: Practice relaxation techniques

## When to use laxatives

- **Follow directions**: Don't take more than recommended
- **Don't rely on them**: Focus on lifestyle changes first

Remember: Constipation is usually not serious and can be managed with diet and lifestyle changes. If it's persistent or severe, talk to your doctor to rule out any underlying conditions.
