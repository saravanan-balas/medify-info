## What Are Cataracts?

Cataracts are like having a cloudy window in your eye - they make your vision blurry and hazy because the clear lens in your eye becomes cloudy. It's like looking through a foggy windshield.

Your eye has a clear lens that helps focus light onto the back of your eye (retina). When this lens gets cloudy, it's called a cataract.
