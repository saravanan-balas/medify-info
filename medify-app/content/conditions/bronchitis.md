## What Is Bronchitis?

Bronchitis is like having a cold that settles in your chest - it makes your airways inflamed and produces too much mucus, making it hard to breathe and causing a persistent cough.

Your airways are like tubes that carry air to your lungs. When they get inflamed, they swell up and produce extra mucus, making it harder for air to flow through.

### Types of Bronchitis

**Acute Bronchitis** - Short-term infection, usually lasts 1-3 weeks
**Chronic Bronchitis** - Long-term condition, part of COPD
**Viral Bronchitis** - Caused by viruses, most common type
**Bacterial Bronchitis** - Caused by bacteria, less common
**Smoker's Bronchitis** - Caused by smoking, can become chronic
