## What Is High Blood Pressure?

High blood pressure is like having too much pressure in your water pipes - it can damage your heart and blood vessels over time. It's often called the "silent killer" because you might not feel any symptoms.

Blood pressure is the force of blood pushing against the walls of your arteries as your heart pumps blood through your body. When this pressure is too high, it can cause serious health problems.

### Blood Pressure Numbers

**Normal**: Less than 120/80 mmHg
**Elevated**: 120-129/less than 80 mmHg
**High Blood Pressure Stage 1**: 130-139/80-89 mmHg
**High Blood Pressure Stage 2**: 140/90 mmHg or higher
**Hypertensive Crisis**: Higher than 180/120 mmHg

## Why Does High Blood Pressure Happen?

### Common Causes

- **Age**: Risk increases as you get older

### What Happens in Your Body

When blood pressure is high, your heart has to work harder to pump blood. This can cause:
