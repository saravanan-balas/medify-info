## What Is Heart Disease?

Heart disease is like having clogged pipes in your heart's plumbing system. The blood vessels that supply your heart muscle get narrowed or blocked, making it harder for your heart to get the oxygen and nutrients it needs.

Your heart is a muscle that pumps blood throughout your body. Like any muscle, it needs oxygen and nutrients to work properly. When the blood vessels that supply your heart get clogged, your heart can't get what it needs.

### Types of Heart Disease

**Coronary Artery Disease** - Clogged arteries supplying the heart
**Heart Attack** - Complete blockage of blood flow to part of the heart
**Heart Failure** - Heart can't pump blood effectively
**Arrhythmia** - Irregular heartbeat
**Valve Disease** - Heart valves don't work properly
**Congenital Heart Disease** - Heart problems present from birth

## Why Does Heart Disease Happen?

### Common Causes

- **Atherosclerosis**: Buildup of plaque in arteries
- **High blood pressure**: Puts strain on heart and blood vessels
- **High cholesterol**: Fatty deposits in blood vessels
- **Smoking**: Damages blood vessels and reduces oxygen
- **Diabetes**: High blood sugar damages blood vessels
- **Obesity**: Extra weight strains the heart
- **Lack of exercise**: Weakens heart muscle
- **Poor diet**: Too much salt, fat, and processed foods
- **Stress**: Chronic stress can damage the heart
- **Age**: Risk increases with age
- **Family history**: Heart disease runs in families

### What Happens in Your Heart

When arteries get clogged with plaque (fatty deposits), blood flow to your heart muscle is reduced. This can cause:
- **Chest pain**: When heart muscle doesn't get enough oxygen
- **Heart attack**: When blood flow is completely blocked
- **Heart failure**: When heart muscle becomes weak and can't pump effectively
- **Arrhythmia**: When electrical signals in the heart get disrupted
